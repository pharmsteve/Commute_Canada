# Immigrant Status and Commuting Times in Canada: A Cross-Sectional Study
This repository provides the analysis code and data availability statement for the study: "Immigrant Status and Commuting Times in Canada: A Cross-Sectional Analysis"

**Overview**
The code in this replication package constructs the analysis file from one data source (Statistics Canada, 2019) using R. One R Markdown file runs all of the code to generate the three tables in the paper. The replicator should expect the code to run in under 5 minutes.

**Data Availability and Provenance Statements**
The Data used in this exercise were obtained through ODESI, a service provided by the Ontario Council of University Libraries (https://search1.odesi.ca/#/Links to an external site).

**Code**
The statistical code used for the analysis is provided in an R Markdown file included in this repository.

**Computational requirements**
The analysis was run on a Windows 11 PC with a 64-bit 11th Generation Intel Core i5 processor (2.40GHz), with 8Gig of RAM.
R version 4.2.3 was used.

**Description of programs/code**
The R Markdown file is detailedly annotated.
1. Download dataset
2. Edit the "import dataset" code line to reflect your local directory
3. Press "Run All" in R Markdown. No further action is required on the replicator's part.
The provided code replicates all three tables in the paper.
